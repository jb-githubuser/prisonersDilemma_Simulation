The code for my paper "Which Machine-Learning Models Do You Want On Your Ocean’s Eleven:  A Computational Prisoner’s Dilemma Simulation" open sourced. 

Hey everyone

My name is Jayden Bai and I am an undergraduate at Emory University studying Statistics + CS and minoring in Neuroethics. I created this project to learn more about machine-learning and I had an interest in game theory. Feel free to message me or connect if you have any questions about the paper!

The game/simulation was programmed in Java which used FileWriter to create CSV to be then be processed and visualized in Python. 

I encourage anyone to tweak the code and run their own simulations and see what new implications can be made from this simulation. Make sure to change the paths to each dataset if you're going to implement your own data into the Python analysis. 

Thanks for reading!
